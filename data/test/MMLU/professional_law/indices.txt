Prompt:
Question: When a buyer and a seller executed a valid contract for the sale of a house, the buyer gave the seller $1,000 as earnest money. The contract noted that the earnest money tendered would be applied to the purchase price at the time of sale but was silent as to remedies in the event of any default. Just before the closing, the buyer lost her job. The buyer told the seller that she could no longer purchase the house and asked him to return the earnest money. The seller accurately told the buyer that the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money; that if the seller sued the buyer for damages, he would receive a minimum of $5,000; and that it would be difficult for him to sell the house in the current market. Should the buyer get the earnest money back? 
A. No, because the contract was silent regarding remedies.
B. No, because the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money.
C. Yes, because the buyer is no longer ready, willing, and able to purchase the house.
D. Yes, because the reason for the buyer's default was not anticipated.
Answer: B

Question: Without a warrant, police officers searched the garbage cans in the alley behind a man's house and discovered chemicals used to make methamphetamine, as well as cooking utensils and containers with the man's fingerprints on them. The alley was a public thoroughfare maintained by the city, and the garbage was picked up once a week by a private sanitation company. The items were found inside the garbage cans in plastic bags that had been tied closed and further secured with tape. The man was charged in federal court with the manufacture of methamphetamine. Did the search of the garbage cans violate the Fourth Amendment? 
A. No, because the man had no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage left in the alley.
B. No, because the probative value of the evidence outweighs the man's modest privacy claims in his garbage.
C. Yes, because the alley was within the curtilage of the man's home and entry without a warrant was unconstitutional.
D. Yes, because there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in one's secured garbage containers.
Answer: A

Question: A man borrowed $500,000 from a bank, securing the loan with a mortgage on a commercial building he owned. The mortgage provided as follows: "No prepayment may be made on this loan during the first two years after the date of this mortgage. Thereafter, prepayment may be made in any amount at any time but only if accompanied by a prepayment fee of 5% of the amount prepaid." One year later, the man received an unexpected cash gift of $1 million and wished to pay off the $495,000 principal balance still owed on the loan. $495,000 principal balance still owed on the loan. Concerned that the bank might refuse prepayment, despite a rise in market interest rates in the year since the loan was made, or at least insist on the 5% prepayment fee, the man consulted an attorney concerning the enforceability of the above-quoted clause. There is no applicable statute. What is the attorney likely to say? 
A. The entire clause is unenforceable, because it violates a public policy favoring the prompt and early repayment of debt.
B. The entire clause is unenforceable, because the rise in interest rates will allow the bank to reloan the funds without loss.
C. The two-year prepayment prohibition and the prepayment fee provision are both valid and enforceable.
D. The two-year prepayment prohibition is unenforceable, but the prepayment fee provision is enforceable.
Answer: D

Question: A rescuer was driving on an isolated portion of a country road. His headlights caught a figure lying at the side of the road. The rescuer stopped to investigate and found a victim, who was bleeding from head wounds and appeared to have been severely beaten. The rescuer then lifted the victim into his car and drove her to the hospital, a half-hour trip. When they arrived at the hospital, the rescuer carried the victim into the emergency room. He left her with a nurse and then returned home. Although the victim recovered from her injuries, she sued the hospital for malpractice, claiming that she was not promptly given medical attention. At trial, the nurse proposes to testify that when the victim was first brought to the hospital, she was unconscious. The victim's attorney objects and moves to strike the nurse's testimony. The trial judge should
A. sustain the objection, because it goes to an ultimate issue in the case. 
B. sustain the objection, because the nurse is not qualified to render an expert opinion. 
C. overrule the objection, because it is a shorthand rendition of what she observed. 
D. overrule the objection, because there are independent grounds to show a present sense impression. 
Answer: C
