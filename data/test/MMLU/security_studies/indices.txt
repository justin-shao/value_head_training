Question: What has been the effect of chemical weapons on international society?
A. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.
B. The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.
C. Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.
D. While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the "poor mans" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.
Answer: D

Question: Which of the following statements best describes the wider security impacts of disease in terms of achieving security?

B. As levels of infection within a population rise, the potential for strategically important groups such as civil servants, judges, and government officials etc to become infected will also rise, thus directly challenging regime security.
C. Disease within a population threatens security both directly and indirectly, as it affects the health of the individual as well as the ability of that individual to perform vital roles within the wider society.
D. Health issues, such as the prevalence of infectious disease or the ability of citizens to participate in military service, are not a matter of concern for security analysts.
Answer: C
