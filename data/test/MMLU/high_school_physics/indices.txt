Answer: A

Question: An equal number of hydrogen and carbon dioxide molecules are placed in a sealed container. The gases are initially at a temperature of 300 K when the container is placed in an oven and brought to a new equilibrium temperature of 600 K. Which of the following best describes what is happening to the molecular speeds and kinetic energies of the gasesâ€™ molecules as they move from 300 K to 600 K?
A. The molecules of both gases, on average, end with the speed and the same average kinetic energy.
B. The molecules of hydrogen, on average, end with a higher speed, but the molecules of both gases end with the same average kinetic energy.
C. The molecules of hydrogen, on average, speed up more and end with a higher average kinetic energy.
D. As heat flows into the container, the entropy rises, and it is not possible to determine the average velocity and average kinetic energy of the gases.
Answer: B
