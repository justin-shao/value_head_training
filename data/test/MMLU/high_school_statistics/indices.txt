Question: A local library has a scanner to detect library materials that have not been checked out. Each item has a chip somewhere inside. Upon checkout, the chip is deactivated so the scanner will not set off the alarm. The scanner has a 98% chance of detecting an active chip (meaning the material has not been checked out) and setting off the alarm. The scanner also has a 3% chance of sounding the alarm when someone passes through without an active chip. It is estimated that 0.5% of library customers actually try to leave the library with an active chip. What is the probability that, if the alarm sounds, the patron leaving the library has an item with an active chip?
A. 0.0049
B. 0.0348
C. 0.141
D. 0.97
Answer: C

Question: A skeptic decides to conduct an experiment in ESP in which a blindfolded subject calls out the color of a card dealt from a regular deck of cards (half the cards are red; the other half, black).

Using a 5 percent level of significance, what is the lowest number of cards that the subject needs to call out correctly in order to show that he is doing better than he would if he were simply guessing?
A. 51
B. 59
C. 75
